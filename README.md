Currently is working only on Linux, with plans to support macOS and Windows, Android and iOS in the future.

It uses:
- [egui](https://crates.io/crates/egui) with [eframe](https://crates.io/crates/eframe) for GUI
- [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio) for concurrency
- [tonic](https://crates.io/crates/tonic) for gRPC communication between GUI and daemon
- [diesel](https://crates.io/crates/diesel) with Sqlite for ORM
